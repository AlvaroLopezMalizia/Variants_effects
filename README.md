# Variants effects
## Further Data Exploration 🚀

- **Analyzing variant effects and their counts:** 🧬
  - Counting the occurrences of different effects in the dataset.

- **Filtering and selecting specific variants based on their effects:** 🔍
  - Filtering the dataset to select variants with specific effects (e.g., `stop_lost`, `stop_gained`).

- **Exploring read depth per genomic position and visualizing it with scatter plots:** 📊
  - Investigating the read depth at different genomic positions and visualizing the data using scatter plots.
